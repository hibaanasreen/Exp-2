# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To design and develop UML diagrams for a Library Management System that manages book records, member information, and borrowing/return transactions efficiently.

# SRS (Procedure):
1.Identify main actors: Librarian, Member (Student/Staff), and System Database.

2.Define core functions: issue book, return book, search book, and manage members.

3.Specify system requirements (functional and non-functional).

4.Draw UML diagrams to represent system structure and interactions.

# RESULT:
Thus, the Library Management System was successfully designed using UML diagrams, clearly representing the functional flow, data handling, and interactions among system components.
